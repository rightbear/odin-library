# odin-library
Project: Library

This is the eighth project to work in the "JavaScript Course"

Github page: https://rightbear.github.io/odin-library/

(2025/04/09) I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I combine HTML elements like dialog and form to design the website. Futhermore, I use CSS concepts such as data attribute, and use Javascript concepts such as object. With advices in Assignment of the project, I mainly use the concept of objects and object constructors to design the array. This activity strengths my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
