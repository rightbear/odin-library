Project: Library

This is the eighth project to work in the "JavaScript Course"

(2025/04/09) I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I combine HTML elements like dialog and form to design the website. Futhermore, I use CSS concepts such as data attribute, and use Javascript concepts such as object. With advices in Assignment of the project, I mainly use the concept of objects and object constructors to design the array. This activity strengths my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

(2025/05/10) I modify this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I refactor the origin Book plain constructor with class style to design my Book class. Futhermore, I create a new branch called "class-style" to test my new class function and make sure it maintains the same functions as before. After finshing the test, I merge the commits in "class-style" branch back to the "main" branch. I mainly use the concept of class including instance fields, static features and private properties. This activity strengths my skills in JavaScript.
